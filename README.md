(Link to my about me: https://github.com/flowingblaze/flowingblaze.github.io/blob/d4775ca496057dd7ee1f5c3277b927c235a087d9/Aboutme.md) 

You can call me Blaze. My full name is Theseus B. Fall. I create Videos and streams. I upload them on Youtube but this is the first place that all my content goes after I figure out how github pages works. I created this site on 8/6/2022. I am 17 years old. I have some chronic pain issues and a chronic respriatory issues. I am a queer person who uses memories/memories pronouns. You have to use memories/memories for me.

I make gaming videos and I upload content related to WOS, A mix of minecraft smp and an original story of mine. I also plan to make Irl content.
Early Life

I have wanted to make minecraft youtube videos since I was small, I started with another youtube channel I made which was a mix of IRL stuff and animal jam content. I loved animal jam when I was younger. I also edited tons of videos that I never uploaded about a creative project of mine that was a mix of animation, art, book series, comic, and video game. I made an endless amount of videos in movie maker for fun. I ended up taking a break in middle school and ended up picking content creation back up in late 2020.
Recent Life

what ended up throwing me back into content creation was Technoblade, Wilbur Soot, and The Dream smp as a whole. Early 2020 was rought for me not only with the pandemic but with a matter in my personal life that greatly traumatized me, this ended up bleeding into most of my 2020 even after what was going on ended. It wasn't pretty, but after many encounters with content related to dream smp and minecraft youtube I ended up watching Technoblade, and getting into dream smp because of him and because I liked wilbur soots pogtopia skin. Trenchcoats were the peak of fashion to me. In my opinon, Technoblade saved my life. Multiple times. He is my idol and my hero (alongside Wilbur Soot) and I named myself Theseus because of him. I started making stuff again because of him.

Technoblade died of cancer. I am making videos not only because I have a passion for creation but also to keep up his memory, He saved my life and he deserves to be remebered. I figured my content which he inspired would be a good way to honor his legacy.

This page is not a portfolio or whatever but just a backup of my content with some bonuses. Its a way to talk about my creative projects that I do under Flowingblaze. Consider this page a record of one of my projects that will take my entire life, and will only be completed once I can no longer make videos (aka once I am dead).
